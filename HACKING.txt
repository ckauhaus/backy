Development
===========

Backy is intended to be compatible with Python 3.3 and 3.4. It is expected to
work properly on Linux and Mac OS X, even though specific backends may not be
avaible on some platforms::

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/flyingcircus/backy
    $ cd backy
    $ virtualenv --python=python3.4 .
    $ bin/pip install zc.buildout
    $ bin/buildout

Running tests
=============

Backy has some end-to-end tests which take a while. To run only quick unit
tests::

    $ bin/py.test

To run all tests::

    $ bin/py.test -m 1
