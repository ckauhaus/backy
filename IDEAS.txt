- get unit test coverage
- implement a scheduler for multiple sources (that can verify)
- simple compound call/configuration (e.g. for many rbd volumes)
- ability to thin out (merge) older deltas
- keep multiple full backups?
- fuse layer to enable direct (loop-mountable) access to old versions
- ability to store blocks in a simple big pool using their hash?
-- may not be that helpful as we really want the primary full backups to 
   be directly, low-level copyable

- implement detection which blocks are actually used by the filesystem and optionally limit backups (for thin provisioning)
  to those areas

- check /proc, /sys or some other interface to detect which blocks were written to
